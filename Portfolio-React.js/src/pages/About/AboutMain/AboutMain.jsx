                    Hello, my name is Tomo. I was born and raised in Japan.
                    After graduating from university, I worked in digital
                    marketing and as a counsellor at a tourist information
                    center in Tokyo.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    In order to become a front-end developer, I am currently
                    studying programming with a focus on JavaScript at a college
                    in Vancouver. In addition to coding, I also love photo
                    processing, video editing, and digital marketing. I am
                    familiar with all areas of the web and can handle a wide
                    range of tasks from design, development, and analysis.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    I am a very passionate and curious person who pursues
                    everything to the fullest. There are still many things that
                    I have yet to learn, but I am eager to learn and improve my
                    skills.
                </p>
